## BGR: three channels: blue, green, and red. 
## HSV color space represents colors based on their hue, saturation, and value. 
## Hue describes the color itself (e.g., red, blue, yellow).
## saturation represents the purity of the color (i.e., how much white is mixed in).
## value represents the brightness of the color.
